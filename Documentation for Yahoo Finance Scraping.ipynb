    "# Stock Price Scraping Project Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is a Python script that scrapes historical stock prices from Yahoo Finance, allowing users to retrieve and visualize the past 1 month data for a specified stock symbol. The script utilizes web scraping techniques to extract data from the Yahoo Finance website.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python 3.x\n",
    "- Required libraries: `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the required libraries using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clone the repository:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-scraper.git\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Navigate to the project directory:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    cd stock-price-scraper\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Run the script:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python stock_scraper.py\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run the script.\n",
    "2. Enter the stock symbol when prompted.\n",
    "3. View the scraped data and the plot of the past 1 month stock prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The main script file is `stock_scraper.py`, and it uses the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `get_stock_data(stock_symbol)`: Fetches historical stock prices using web scraping.\n",
    "- `plot_stock_data(df, stock_symbol)`: Plots the closing prices for the past 1 month.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "The project relies on Yahoo Finance as the data source for historical stock prices. Ensure that the specified stock symbol is valid and listed on Yahoo Finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter issues fetching data or running the script, consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensure a stable internet connection.\n",
    "- Check if the specified stock symbol is valid and listed on Yahoo Finance.\n",
    "- Verify that the required libraries are installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "Contributions to the project are welcome. If you find any bugs, have feature requests, or want to contribute improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.\n",
